//
// This file contains the actual code for the functions that will implement the
// reliable transport protocols enabling entity "A" to reliably send information
// to entity "B".
//
// This is where you should write your code, and you should submit a modified
// version of this file.
//
// Notes:
// - One way network delay averages five time units (longer if there are other
//   messages in the channel for GBN), but can be larger.
// - Packets can be corrupted (either the header or the data portion) or lost,
//   according to user-defined probabilities entered as command line arguments.
// - Packets will be delivered in the order in which they were sent (although
//   some can be lost).
// - You may have global state in this file, BUT THAT GLOBAL STATE MUST NOT BE
//   SHARED BETWEEN THE TWO ENTITIES' FUNCTIONS. "A" and "B" are simulating two
//   entities connected by a network, and as such they cannot access each
//   other's variables and global state. Entity "A" can access its own state,
//   and entity "B" can access its own state, but anything shared between the
//   two must be passed in a `pkt` across the simulated network. Violating this
//   requirement will result in a very low score for this project (or a 0).
//
// To run this project you should be able to compile it with something like:
//
//     $ gcc entity.c simulator.c -o myproject
//
// and then run it like:
//
//     $ ./myproject 0.0 0.0 10 500 3 test1.txt
//
// Of course, that will cause the channel to be perfect, so you should test
// with a less ideal channel, and you should vary the random seed. However, for
// testing it can be helpful to keep the seed constant.
//
// The simulator will write the received data on entity "B" to a file called
// `output.dat`.
